# Part A — Research (Free Tier Comparison)

## What is Cloud Computing?
- Cloud computing means using computing services like servers, storage, databases, networking, and software through the internet instead of owning physical hardware.  
- It allows users to access resources on-demand from anywhere with an internet connection.  
- Cloud makes it easy to scale up or scale down resources depending on usage.  
- It reduces cost because we don’t need to buy and maintain expensive systems locally.  
- Most cloud providers offer pay-as-you-go pricing and free tiers for beginners.  
- Cloud is widely used for hosting websites, running applications, storing data, and backups.
